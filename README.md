This git repository contains scripts used to perform temporal and genomic analysis of additive genetic variance in different stages of a simulated wheat breeding program. Furthermore, we fitted both full Bayesian and empirical Bayesian to account for uncertainty. The manuscript is submitted to Heredity and the citation will be updated.

Please see folder Scripts_GenVar. Inside this folder there are two folders: 
1. 10simulations: it has the scripts optimised to run the 10 repetitions of analysis; 
2. Result_paper: it has the scripts used to simulate the breeding programme, and to perform all analyses cited in the paper (together with scripts for graphs and tables).
