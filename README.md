This git repository contains scripts for temporal and genomic analysis of additive genetic variance in different stages of a simulated wheat breeding program. See the paper for further details.

There are two folders: 
1. 10simulations: it has the scripts optimised to run the 10 repetitions of analysis; 
2. Result_paper: it has the scripts used to simulate the breeding programme, and to perform all analyses cited in the paper (together with scripts for graphs and tables). Please, note that scripts in this folder uses AlphaSimR version 0.11.0!;
3. Sensitivity_Genetic_Architecture: it has the scripts to test our framework by varying the number of QTL and by adding genotype-by-year interaction. Please, note that scripts in this folder uses AlphaSimR version 1.0.1.
